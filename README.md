# Bot-source-code
You can use this bot and it's code, just dm/contact me first
Discord: HRLO77#3508

IMPORTANT: I used multiple modules while developing this discord bot, tracemalloc, discord.py api module, ctypes, and a few I compiled myself. For the bot to properly work without errors, you must install these packages with a command line or a package installer. Feel free to go ahead and change the code, add commands, make it more user friendly, or make it more efficient.
I will review the pull requests sent and get back to your if possible within 1-3 weeks if you provide methods of contact. If you provide a comprehensive list of changes or lines you changed I would be able to review the code much faster and get back to you sooner.

If you need a link to servers where this bot is, you can just contact me.

If you want to be a bot tester, let me know.

btw the parts in the code where it says, ('Mute role here, or blank'), that role_id is the role with the muted permissions you want to add to mute the members, leave it blank if you want to mute members individually without adding a role to them(NOTE: If you are adding a role, it expects roles to have proper permissions for muting, as it will not mute then.)
