The moderation bot of HRLO77's class and personal discord server


You can use this bot and it's code, just dm/contact me first
 
Discord: HRLO77#3508

IMPORTANT: I used multiple modules while developing this discord bot, tracemalloc, discord.py api module/disnake/py-cord (idk really), ctypes, and a few I compiled myself. For the bot to properly work without errors, you must install these packages with a command line or a package installer. Feel free to go ahead and change the code, add commands, make it more user friendly, or make it more efficient.
I will review the pull requests sent and get back to your if possible within 1-3 weeks if you provide methods of contact. If you provide a comprehensive list of changes or lines you changed I would be able to review the code much faster and get back to you sooner.

If you need a link to servers where this bot is, you can just contact me.

If you want to be a bot tester, let me know.

If you are creating an instance of the bot, or using it in a new server, do NOT manually create roles called, 'muted' or 'file_muted' as those are reserved for the bot. When you first use mute and file_mute commands, it will return an error as it is setting up the roles, wait a few seconds, then try muting and file_muting a user again. Then you have setup the muting system!

Fill in the dictionary in the first few lines after imports if you want to create a default role syntax for your guild.

You can comment all the lines of code in the on_ready, except the last print line to stop the bot from direct messaging all the members in all the guilds.


Here is the documentation for the commands - https://pastebin.com/9w4Fp110
