# Bot-source-code


The moderation bot of HRLO77's class and personal discord server.


You can use this bot and it's code, just dm/contact me first.

IMPORTANT: I used multiple modules while developing this discord bot, tracemalloc, discord.py api module/disnake/py-cord (idk really), ctypes, and a few I compiled myself. For the bot to properly work without errors, you must install these packages with a command line or a package installer. Feel free to go ahead and change the code, add commands, make it more user friendly, or make it more efficient.
I will review the pull requests sent and get back to your if possible within 1-3 weeks if you provide methods of contact. If you provide a comprehensive list of changes or lines you changed I would be able to review the code much faster and get back to you sooner.

If you need a link to servers where this bot is, you can just contact me.

If you want to be a bot tester, let me know.!

Fill in the dictionary in the first few lines after imports if you want to create a default role syntax for your guild.

The code now automatically installs and updates the API wrappers and extra modules. NOTE: The commands for installing these modules works only Windows systems, not linux or macOS.
