You can use this bot and it's code, just dm/contact me first
Discord: HRLO77#3508

IMPORTANT: I used multiple modules while developing this discord bot, tracemalloc, discord.py api module, ctypes, and a few I compiled myself. For the bot to properly work without errors, you must install these packages with a command line or a package installer. Feel free to go ahead and change the code, add commands, make it more user friendly, or make it more efficient.
I will review the pull requests sent and get back to your if possible within 1-3 weeks if you provide methods of contact. If you provide a comprehensive list of changes or lines you changed it would be able to to review and much faster and get back to you sooner.

If you need a link to servers where this bot is, you can just contact me.
